Baber Custom Builders has years of experience with creating custom office space from a blank canvas.  Our work includes several medical facilities, and a large church.

## Medical facility experience

We have built out space for several chiropractors and vision clinics, and have the experience to understand the unique needs of these businesses such as: custom X-ray rooms, reception counters, and quiet rooms for sensory experiences and personal medical conversations.

## Experience working with local inspectors to get your business opened on time

Our work has spanned most of the jurisdictions in the Des Moines metro area.  We know how to ensure you meet ADA compliance, and get your inspection completed to ensure you open on time.
